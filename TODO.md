# TODO

- Grok `ask-incognito` currently prevents local resume-state persistence only.
- Investigate and implement reliable server-side conversation deletion/hiding for X/Grok so incognito prompts do not appear in X history.
- Add verification coverage for this behavior (integration test or scripted post-run history check).
